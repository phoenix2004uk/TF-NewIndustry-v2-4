# TF-NewIndustry-v2-4
This mod adds new types of goods and new goods production chains to Transport Fever

The mod was originally posted on the Steam Workshop here [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=924099338&searchtext=]
and has been released here with permission from the author to distribute some compatability fixes for the experimental gameplay patch
for Transport Fever

This release will only be maintained until such time as the author releases or incorporates updates to the original mod as hosted on
the Steam Workshop

All original copyrights belong to the original author "Vitaro" on Steam, and as stated on the Workshop page
"Mod creators are not responsible for the mod and/or game performance. Use this mod on your own risk."

A screenshot has been included of the author granting permission for me to publish this patch to the public

These patched version is supplied as-is, though updates may be made if required.


## Installation
To reduce risk of errors and conflicts once the original mod is updated, I will only be releasing this on GitHub and not on the
Steam Workshop. As such, you will need to manually install the updated version of the mod, over the original. I accept no responsability
if things get screwed up. The patch has been used successfully by SkyeStorme on YouTube with no ill effects.

If you installed the original mod through steam, it should be located here [\steamapps\workshop\content\446800\924099338\]
in your default Steam or SteamLibrary folder [default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam]

Just download and over-write the old mod, it *should* be replaced if and when the Steam Workshop version is updated

## Problems
If you have any issues or encounter any bugs, please raise an issue on GitHub. I will not be monitoring the Steam Workshop comments section for any problems with this patch
